sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo apt-get install nginx -y

nginx -v

sudo systemctl restart nginx

sudo apt-get install curl

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -

sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

npx create-react-app react-tutorial

cd react-tutorial

npm run build

npm start

       custom tcp and anywhere --- port range 3000
